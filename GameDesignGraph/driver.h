	//INIT – Reset the graph
	void INIT();


	//ADDV – Request a string, then add that string as a vertex.
	void ADDV();
	
	
	//ADDE – Request the name of two vertices, then a weight between the vertices.Creates an edge based on this info.

	//PRINT – Prints each vertex in the graph, along with all edges and weights associated with the vertex.
	//The output might look like…
	//Atlanta; Adjacent: Houston (800), Washington (600)

	//TEST1 – Initializes the graph.Then insert the vertices and edges defined for the example on slide 6 in lecture 24 (Game Map and Graphs).
